# The journey here

## *24-12-2024*

I was thinking of making my first blog about Bullet Journaling. A technique
in which you keep a journal and plan your future, months and days in a paper
notebook called a Bullet Journal. Even though Bullet Journaling has been an
important aspect in my life, it wasn't the right topic for the first blog.

With the start of this blog I want to provide the reader a description of
the road here. It can be a starting point to become more familiar with me
as the writer. While reading you might recognize some of the same struggles
and outcomes of choices we make on the way.

After I graduated in Public Administration, I wasn't able to find a job in
my field. Or more specifically, I wasn't able to find a job where I would get
hired. At the time data and data privacy was quite a hot topic. As curious as
I am, I wanted to know how data was gathered and how I could protect my privacy.

This curiosity into data lead me to look up courses on data on Coursera. This is
how I discovered the Data Science course. Not really knowing what Data Science was I decided to dive in. In the course you would also learn Python, a language I had already very little experimented with.

It took me close to a year to finish this course. Afterwards, I kind of knew that I was sort of familiar with the concepts but definitely didn't master the techniques. This left me wondering if I should do more courses or try to somehow continue by myself. I checked out a course on Data Engineering but decided against it. I would be able to finish this course but I would be left with the same outcome namely, no skills mastered. Since I didn't really possess the skills on Data Science, it was not a smart option to continue on my own. I needed guidance.

Meanwhile I was hired in a call center, to generate some income. I can only say one thing, this was not something I wanted to do, even for a year. So I quit after seven months. Since I really liked programming I looked for something that people could learn by themselves and enough free resources were available online. A video by Dorian Develops really inspired me and introduced me to FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project.

I started with FreeCodeCamp first but moved on to The Odin Project (TOP) as I liked that you were working with real tools and it really pushed you to come up with solutions yourself. Even though it drove me almost crazy sometimes to figure something out.

The internet is filled with tips and tricks on things not to do when starting to learn programming. Even TOP starts with some. But this didn't prevent me from making these mistakes because I was stubborn. When I started with TOP I mostly skipped the HTML and CSS lessons as I wanted to learn JavaScript. I need not tell you that this resulted in failure and prevented me from finishing the first section.

On my second attempt, I ended up in tutorial hell. With every lesson on TOP I decided to some equivalent lesson on other platforms or just dive deep into the topic. This slowed my progress and made me forget the essentials whenever I needed to remember things in the hands-on projects. So I failed again.

Luckily, I learned from my mistakes and succeeded on my third attempt. I decided to only focus on TOP and go through the lessons in detail and on a steady pace. It was still incredibly hard at times and I definitely felt like quitting but I persevered through. Why? Well what was the alternative if I didn't follow up with this and I had finally found something I was quite passionate about.

I probably spent close to a year to go through the full TOP curriculum. The hardest part was definitely the section on vanilla Javascript. Learning React & NodeJS was relatively easy after mastering Javascript. The thrill of starting and finishing the last project is something I will remember for a long time. This long marathon had come to an end.

Lastly, I want to mention the thing that kept me going, even through the really rough parts. Before starting my last attempt I told myself I was joining a boxing tournament. No matter if I win or lose today, I will show up tomorrow. I will continue to show up until I finish this and make it to the final round.
